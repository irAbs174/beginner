4. Using jQuery to place the content received from the server side on the client side
5. Monitor app to control the site resources for the system administrator and to announce the details of CPU consumption, temporary memory, cache memory, hard disk, network and running commands at any moment (htop) with bootstrap format
6. Complete and complex parts for professional stores including brands, blogs, categories, discounted products and discounts and codes
